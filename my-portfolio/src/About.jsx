        <h3>About Me</h3>
        I am a friendly and dedicated software engineer with a strong work ethic, actively seeking new challenges and opportunities to enhance my
        performance. Collaborative and open to sharing ideas, yet adept at working independently, I am a supportive team player committed to task completion and target achievement.
        I have a natural interest in computers, coding, and technology, with a particular passion for problem-solving in development. I enjoy the creative process of putting ideas into action when building applications. I also believe that software development has an important
        impact on our society and I value the continuous learning and growth opportunities in the evolving tech field. I have a natural interest in computers, coding and technology. Another thing I really like is the problem solving part of developing and finding a solution is one of my favourite parts because
        when solving it, you can then learn from the error you&apos;ve made. Having the chance to put your ideas and create it is also something I really enjoy when building a new application. As a developer we can also be very impactful to society, having the ability to create software that can impact individuals. The tech field is always evolving which offers us endless amounts of opportunities for learning and growth.</div>
